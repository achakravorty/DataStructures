Write a method that transforms a graph in an adjacency matrix data structure (represented as an int[][]) to a graph in an adjacency map data structure (represented as a List<Map<Integer,Integer>>).

Note that there cannot be edges with weight 0. Instead, a 0 in the adjacency matrix int[][] represents that there is no edge.

Then, do the same vice versa.
